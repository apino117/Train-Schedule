# Train-Schedule

Welcome to the Train-Schedule page - the world's...page! It is technically of the world so I'm not wrong in saying that!

Train scheduler is for all ages, although if you're looking up train times as a kid you're clearly on a whole different plane. 

The goal of this page is to help people find when their trains are gonna arrive so that they can have a pleasant life filled with public transportation.

To start fill out the forms with their corresponding bits of info and put your train up on the board! Once you do that it'll stay there and you can look at all it's glory!

If you need any assistance or have any questions please be advised asking government officials about the inner workings of public transit is a journey.

Good voyage!
